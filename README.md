# ACCT
Author Conference Citation Topic Model

The code is based on GibbsLDA++ (http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/). I modified the LDA implementation so that it can also capture topic distributions of author, conference, and citations.

Most of the places that I modified should be labeled by "add by liu liu". But it's been a while since I did this project.
